# ðŸ¥§ Energiekuchen

A visual energy management tool that helps users balance their daily energy sources and drains through interactive pie charts.

## What is Energiekuchen?

Energiekuchen is a client-side web application that serves as a visual coaching tool for energy management. Users can create dual pie charts to visualize:

- **âš¡ Positive Energy Sources** (activities that give energy): sports, relaxation, time with friends
- **ðŸ”‹ Energy Drains** (activities that consume energy): overtime work, stress, difficult conversations

The application helps identify energy imbalances and plan improvements to achieve better work-life balance.
